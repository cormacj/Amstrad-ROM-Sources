# About this file

I started to work on the disassembly of AMSDOS.ROM because I wanted to see how
Amstrads handled booting CP/M. I got a little way into the initial prep work, and
then I discovered the work had already been done when I was browsing ACPC.me.

I wasn't able to track down the original author, so if you know who did this work,
please let me know.

This code is also rather hard to properly google, so I decided to ditch my work and
include this in this repository in the hope that perhaps it one day is noticed by
search engine.
